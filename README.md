## Description

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge, click the link above to visit the challenge page. 

## Built with 

<p>HTML<p>
<p>CSS<p>
<p>Flexbox<p>
<p>Javascript<p>

## What I learnt 

This was a lot harder than it looks, I struggled a lot with the javascript, I've not created a form before where I needed to take data from multiple inputs and radio buttons. I've not styled radio buttons this way before, I'm sure there is an easier method than what I settled on, admittedly with the help of ChatGPT. 

I thought this project would have been over fairly quickly, I was wrong, I need to go back over the fundementals of Javascript.
